# 👋 Hi, I’m Avinash Turkar

I love digging into data to understand how things work and how they can work better. At Amazon, I work with Excel and Pivot Tables to track performance, analyze metrics, and create reports that have improved resolution rates by 15% and team performance by 5–10%.

Outside of work, I enjoy solving real-world data problems using SQL, Power BI, and Python.
